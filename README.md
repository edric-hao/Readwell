Readwell: A LBYCPEI Final Project by Edric Hao and Madelein Villegas

Readwell is a book recommender Android app which will be created using Java. The app has 3 main pages: Home, Books, and Search.

The Home page is where the user can see the highly-rated books in each category. The user can browse the Home page and see the book title along with necessary information such as the author, rating, synopsis, year, and book cover. The information regarding the books will be coming from the Goodreads dataset or will be web scraped, whichever yields a more complete dataset.

Each user will also have a customizable book list where he/she can list down the books. The user has 3 lists: Books Read, Books Reading, and Books to Read. The user has the ability to add and remove books to these lists. The user can also move books from one list to another. The user can also see the book information in these lists. The information the user will see includes the book title, author, rating, year, and book cover.

Finally, the Search page will be used for the user to search for a book he/she will put on his/her list or look for a book at random. The Search page has different fields where the user can input information regarding the book he/she wants to read. The user can also search or completely random books if the user decides not to filter the search. The filters will be used when querying the dataset in order to return the best recommendations for the user.
